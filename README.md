# Flash Chat

This app uses firebase to provide a really basic chat app between two or more people.
Users can log in/out or sign up, and send and receive chat messages from other users.

This app was the result of a class taught from the good folks at London App Brewery

What was learnt from building this app:

- How to incorporate Firebase into the app
- How to use Firebase authentication to register and sign in users
- How to create animations using the Flutter Hero widget
- How to create custom aniamtions using Flutter's animation controller
- Learn all about mixins and how they differ from superclasses
- Learn about Streams and how they work
- Learn to use ListViews to build scrolling views
- How to use Firebase Cloud Firestore to store and retrieve data on the fly

# IMPORTANT

Please note you will need to set up your own firebase database, as well as download the google services configuration file for either iOS, Android or both and insert it into your project for this to work
